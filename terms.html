Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.</p><p>You agree that all claims, disputes, or disagreements that may arise out of the interpretation or performance of this Agreement, or that in any way relate to your use of the Sites, the Materials, and/or other content on the Sites, shall be submitted exclusively to binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. Arbitration means that an arbitrator and not a judge or jury will decide the claim. Rights to prehearing exchange of information and appeals may also be limited in arbitration. You acknowledge and agree that you and Suna Breakfast are each waiving the right to a trial by jury. You further acknowledge and agree that you waive your right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Suna Breakfast otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms of Use. You further acknowledge that any claim arising under this Agreement must be brought within one year of its accrual or it will be waived.</p><p>II. Arbitration Rules</p><p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/Rules">https://www.adr.org/Rules</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879). The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.</p><p>III. Arbitration Process</p><p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Demand%20for%20Arbitration%20Consumer%20Arbitration%20Rules.pdf">https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Demand%20for%20Arbitration%20Consumer%20Arbitration%20Rules.pdf</a> and a separate affidavit for waiver of fees for California residents only at <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/AAA%20Affidavit%20for%20Waiver%20of%20Fees%20Notice%20California%20Consumers.pdf.">https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/AAA%20Affidavit%20for%20Waiver%20of%20Fees%20Notice%20California%20Consumers.pdf.</a>) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the county in which you reside and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p><p>IV. Arbitration Location and Procedure</p><p>Unless you and Suna Breakfast otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Suna Breakfast submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p><p>V. Arbitrator's Decision</p><p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide the relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration, you will be entitled to an award of attorney's' fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law. Suna Breakfast will not seek, and hereby waives, all rights Suna Breakfast may have under applicable law to recover attorneys' fees and expenses if Suna Breakfast prevails in arbitration.</p><p>VI. Changes</p><p>Suna Breakfast reserves the right to change this "Dispute Resolution" section, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of such amendment. Notwithstanding the provisions of the modification-related provisions above, if Suna Breakfast changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Sites after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes. If you do not agree to such change, you may reject any such change by providing Suna Breakfast written notice of such rejection by mail or hand delivery to: Suna Breakfast, Attn: Dispute Resolutions, 111 West Washington Street, Suite 2100, Chicago, Illinois 60602, or by email from the email address associated with your account to: <a href="mailto:disputeresolution@grubhub.com">contactsuna@sunabreakfast.com</a> within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Effective" date above. In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this "Dispute Resolution" section. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and Suna Breakfast in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement, as applicable).</p><p>WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY</p><p>Any waiver by Suna Breakfast of any provision of this Agreement must be in writing. If any portion of this Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that matches the intent of the original provision as closely as possible except that in the event of unenforceability of the class action waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable. The remainder of this Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to terms contained herein.</p><p>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</p><p>This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Suna Breakfast in connection with the Sites and the services hereunder, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Suna Breakfast concerning the Sites and the services hereunder.</p><p>CONTACT</p><p>If you have any questions regarding this Agreement, please visit our “Contact Us” page for answers and our contact information.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
